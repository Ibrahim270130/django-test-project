Solve Climate

ðŸ§‘ Story
We need to set up a test GitHub repository and initialize a Django project to begin web development. This will provide a structured environment for version control, collaboration, and iterative development of the platform.

ðŸ”¨ Acceptance Criteria

Create a new GitHub repository for the project.
Set up an appropriate repository name and description.
Initialize with a README file and a .gitignore for Python/Django.
Set up a Django project within the repository.
Install Django and create a new project (django-admin startproject project_name).
Set up a virtual environment for dependency management.
Configure the project settings for local development.
Ensure version control and collaboration setup:
Push the initial Django project to GitHub.
Set up branches for development and main releases.
Ensure team members have the necessary access to collaborate.
